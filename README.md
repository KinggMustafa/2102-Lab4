# Flask Server with Token-Based Authentication

# Overview
This project demonstrates a simple client-server interaction using Python's httpx and Flask. The client sends a login request to the server with an ID and token for authentication, and if successful, the client can send further authorized requests to the server. The server then echoes the received data.
